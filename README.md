# t4json Docs
![GitHub Workflow Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybergeek1943/badges/main/build-passing.svg) ![contributions welcome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybergeek1943/badges/main/contributions-welcome.svg)

The t4json module was created to make working with json files in python easier. It is
built on top of the standard json module that comes with python. It is pure python and
does not have any non-standard [dependencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)). Therefore, it should work on a plain install of python 3.6
or later on any OS right out of the box.

Outline:
- Open up json data from a file, url, or string with the T4Json class.
- Use methods to make some changes.
- Save changes.
- That's it. Your done..

&emsp;

### Features

- Use paths to navigate the json data just like in the file system. Also includes relative/absolute path navigating.
- Easily make changes like changing the name of a key, changing a value, adding new items, moving/copying items to new locations, deleting items, flattening, and more. All with easy to use and intuitive methods.
- Easily open up json data - simply pass a File Path, URL, or Json String when creating the T4Json object, and it will automatically figure out what is what and give you the data you need to work with.
- And more.

T4json is designed to simply and easily work with json data without any hassle. It can be used to make simple quick changes, more complex changes, or to just retrieve data. All with only a few lines of code that are easy to understand and read.

&emsp;

### Installation

Using pip:

```pip install t4json```

Or just download the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/cybergeek1943/t4json) and use as a local module within your project... which may be more useful if you want to make changes to it.

&emsp;

### Notes
- All methods within the T4Json class will return un-copied mutable data. This is so that you can access the data and manipulate it just as you would if you were using the json module. You can use the built in ```copy()``` method of the returned mutable data to make a shallow copy... or you can use the copy module to make a deep copy.
- Feel free to open it up and change some default arguments of the methods. If an argument looks like ```<parameter name>: <expected value> = None``` then that default argument needs to be changed with the attributes in the ```__init__()``` method of the T4Json class. __If__ the expected value/s has ```None``` in it like ```<parameter name>:<some expected value> | None = None```. In that case just change the default value of that parameter from ```None``` to something else if the arguments expected values allow it. Any 'flagged' T4Json methods or variables that look like ```__<name of method or var>__``` are not safe to tamper with as they are used by the T4Json class for processing the json data…

&emsp;

### Definitions/Terms
- Anything that holds data is called a **container**. Such as a dictionary or list
- A **pair** is short for a key/value pair or json object.
- A **value** is anything that has a corresponding key or index.
- A **key** is a string that is used to gain access to a value within a pair container.
- An **index** is an integer that is used to gain access to a value within a list container.
- An **item** is a non-container __value__.
- A **pair container** is a dictionary.
- A **list container** is simply a list.
- If a path is set to an empty string ""… it is accessing the base container.

&emsp;

### JSON Conversion Table
Once you are done making changes/creating your json file... it needs to be [serialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) / saved so that it can then be understood by other programs. For python to understand the JSON data it needs to be deserialized/loaded into a python data structure like a dictionary or list. Below are the tables used for that conversion process.

__Converting/Encoding to JSON:__
| Python | t4json | JSON |
|--------|--------|------|
| dict | pair container | object |
| list/tuple | list container | array |
| str | <--------------> | string |
| int, float, int- & float-derived Enums | <--------------> | number
| True | <--------------> | true |
| False | <--------------> | false |
| None | <--------------> | null |



&emsp;

__Converting/Decoding from JSON to Python data structures:__
JSON | t4json | Python
-|-|-
object | pair container | dict
array | list container | list/tuple
string | <--------------> | str
number (int) | <--------------> | int
number (real) | <--------------> | float
true | <--------------> | True
false | <--------------> | False
null | <--------------> | None

#### Editing Methods:
###### _T4Json._ ```add(value, path='', existing_keys='pass', create=False, index=None, integrate_list_with_list=False)```
This method can be used to add new data anywhere in the json data.

___value___ This can be a dictionary of new pairs/s that you want to add to the current data, or it can be a __string__,  __integer__,  __float__,  __boolean__, __none__, __string__, or __list__.

___path___ leads to the location where the data will be added.

___existing_keys___ -  This parameter specifies what to do with keys that already exist on the current level. 
If set to "__pass__" then any key/s that already exists on the current level will be ignored. 
If set to "__replace__" then any key/s that already exist on the current level will have its value be replaced by the value of the new key/s. 
If set to "__combine__" then any key/s that already exist on the current level will have its value be combined with the value of the new key/s in a list.
If set to "__integrate__" then any key/s that already exist on the current level will have its value be integrated as best as possible with the value of the new key/s. If both the new and existing key/s have values that are containers... they will be integrated into ___one___ container.

___create___ when set to ```True``` a list will be created if ```path``` leads to a non-container item. This list will include the non-container item along with the new ```value```. Otherwise, if it is ```False``` it will raise an __```AddError```__.

___index___ when ```path``` leads to a __list__ and this argument is passed and integer... ```value``` will be inserted at the specified index. A string can also be passed to indicate where to place ```value```. It can be "center" (or "half"), "4q", "3q", "2q", "1q" or "0q" (The "q" stands for quarters)... or it can be a positive integer in a string that represents a proportional percentage/scale of where to place ```value```... with "0" being at the start and "100" being the end. When ```None``` is passed, ```value``` will be placed at the end of the list.

___integrate_list_with_list___ - If  ```path``` leads to a list and ```value``` is a list then both lists will be integrated into one list.


&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```change_value(path, new_value)```
This method can be used to change the value of a key anywhere in the json data.

___path___ leads to the key which holds the value you want to change.

___new_value___ is what you want to replace the old value with… It can be a __string__,  __integer__,  __float__,  __boolean__, __none__, __dictionary__, or __list__.


&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```change_key(path, new_key, existing_key='error')```
This method can be used to change the name of a key anywhere in the json data.

___path___ leads to the key that you want to change.

___new_key___ this is the new key… A __string__,  __integer__,  __float__,  __boolean__ or __none__ will be accepted but they of course will be converted to a __string__.

___existing_key___ -  This parameter specifies what to do if a key already exists on the current level. 
If set to "__pass__" then the key that already exists on the current level it will be ignored and nothing will change. 
If set to "__replace__" then the key that already exist on the current level will have its value be replaced by the value of the old key being changed. 
If set to "__combine__" then the key that already exist on the current level will have its value be combined with the value of the old key in a list.
If set to "__integrate__" then the key that already exist on the current level will have its value be integrated as best as possible with the value of the old key. If both the existing and old keys have values that are containers... they will be integrated into ___one___ container.
If set to "__error__" an ```ArgumentError``` will be raised if a key already exists on the current level.


&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```move_from_to(from_path, to_path, only_contents=False, existing_key='pass', create=False, index=None, integrate_list_with_list=False)```

___from_path___ should lead to the key/json object of the data you want to move.

___to_path___ should lead to the location where the data will be moved.

___only_contents___ when set to ```True``` only the contents/value of the key/json object will be moved. Otherwise, if ```False``` the json object/key - value pair itself will be moved.

___existing_keys___ -  This parameter specifies what to do with keys that already exist on the current level. 
If set to "__pass__" then any key/s that already exists on the target level will be ignored.
If set to "__replace__" then any key/s that already exist on the target level will have its value be replaced by the value of the new key/s. 
If set to "__combine__" then any key/s that already exist on the target level will have its value be combined with the value of the new key/s in a list.
If set to "__integrate__" then any key/s that already exist on the target level will have its value be integrated as best as possible with the value of the new key/s. If both the new and existing key/s have values that are containers... they will be integrated into ___one___ container.

___create___ when set to ```True``` a list will be created if ```path``` leads to a non-container item. This list will include the non-container item along with the moved ```value```. Otherwise, if it is ```False``` it will raise an __```AddError```__.

___index___ when ```to_path``` leads to a __list__ and this argument is passed and integer... the _value_ from ```from_path``` will be inserted at the specified index. A string can also be passed to indicate where to place the _value_. It can be "center" (or "half"), "4q", "3q", "2q", "1q" or "0q" (The "q" stands for quarters)... or it can be a positive integer in a string that represents a proportional percentage/scale of where to place the _value_... with "0" being at the start and "100" being the end. When ```None``` is passed, the _value_ will be placed at the end of the list.

___integrate_list_with_list___ - If  ```to_path``` leads to a list and the _value_ from ```from_path``` is a list then both lists will be integrated into one list.


&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```copy_from_to(from_path, to_path, only_contents=False, overwrite_existing=False, create=False, index=None, integrate_list_with_list=False)```

___path___ should lead to the pair/item you want to delete.


&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```delete_empty_containers(path)```
This method can be used to delete any keys with empty containers as _values_.

___path___ should lead to the level in which you want to remove any __keys__ that have an empty container as __values__.


&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```overwrite(start)```
This method can be used to start fresh.

___start___ can be a __dictionary__, __list__, __tuple__ (which will be converted to a list), __string__,  __integer__,  __float__,  __boolean__, or __none__. All current data will be overwritten/replaced with ```start```.


&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```wipe()``` or ```clear()```
Simply deletes everything and leaves you with an empty container.


&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```format(indentation=4, sort_keys=True, only_ascii=False)```
This method formats the json file to make it look nice.

___indentation___ Sets the indentation amount of the json file.

___sort_keys___ Will sort all the keys in the json file in alphabetical and numerical order.

___only_ascii___ will escape any non-ASCII characters.


&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```flatten(path='', chain_key=False, chain_key_separator='_', flatten_opposite_container_type=True, pull_pairs_from_lists=True, pull_lists_from_pairs=False, existing_keys='integrate', list_index=None, delete_empty_containers=True)```
This method flattens nested data.

___path___ can be used to select which level you want to flatten.

___chain_keys___ when set to ```True``` the data will be flattened with all the keys being renamed to include there previous parents names.

__chain_key_separator__ - This is used as the separator between the keys as they are being renamed to include their previous parents names. ```chain_keys``` must be set to ```True``` for this argument to apply.

___flatten_opposite_container_type___ when set to ```True``` the opposite container type of the target one being flattened will also be flattened. For example: If you are flattening a pair container then all the list containers inside the pair container will also be flattened. Or if you are flattening a list container then all the pair containers within that list container will be flattened.

__pull_pairs_from_lists__ - If flatting a pair container... then any pair/s contained in lists will be pulled out and flattened. This will only work if ```flatten_opposite_container_type``` has been set to ```True```.

__pull_list_from_pairs__ - If flatting a list container... then any pair/s within that data that contain lists as values will be pulled out and flattened. This will only work if ```flatten_opposite_container_type``` has been set to ```True```.

___existing_keys___ -  This parameter specifies what to do with keys that already exist on the base level. 
If set to "__pass__" then any key/s that already exists on the base level will be ignored.
If set to "__replace__" then any key/s that already exist on the base level will have its value be replaced by the value of the new key/s. 
If set to "__combine__" then any key/s that already exist on the base level will have its value be combined with the value of the new key/s in a list.
If set to "__integrate__" then any key/s that already exist on the base level will have its value be integrated as best as possible with the value of the new key/s. If both the new and existing key/s have values that are containers... they will be integrated into ___one___ container.

___list_index___ when a _list_ is being flattened any nested contents will be pulled to the specified index. A string can also be passed to indicate where to place the _value_. It can be "center" (or "half"), "4q", "3q", "2q", "1q" or "0q" (The "q" stands for quarters)... or it can be a positive integer in a string that represents a proportional percentage/scale of where to place the _value_... with "0" being at the start and "100" being the end. When ```None``` is passed, the _value_ will be placed at the end of the list. If a nested _list_ is being flattened, and you want the contents to keep their positions than pass "hold".

___delete_empty_containers___ - Once the flatting is all done and dusted and if this is set to ```True``` then any keys with empty containers as values will be deleted.

___separators___ Must be a tuple with two items. The fist is used to separate pairs or items. It is ", " by default. The second is used to separate key and values. It is ": " by default.


&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```json_string(path='', indent=None, sort_keys=None, only_ascii=None, separators=None)```
Returns a json formatted string. This string can then.. for example be saved to a file.

___path___ Leads to the key that will have its value be returned as a json formatted string.

___indent___ Can be an _Integer_, _String_, or _None_. If an _Integer_ is passed then the json will have its indentation set to the specified amount of whitespaces. If a _string_ is passed then it will be used as the indentation space. If _None_ is passed then there will be no indentation.

___sort_keys___ When ```True``` is passed the key will be sorted in alphabetical/numerical order.

___only_ascii___ When set to ```True``` any non-ascii characters will be escaped/encoded.

___separators___ Must be a tuple with two items. The fist is used to separate pairs or items. It is ", " by default. The second is used to separate key and values. It is ": " by default.


&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```new()```
Receives whatever is passed to _value_ as the new json data to work with. This way you could pass a dictionary or list and that would become the data you work with and save as JSON.



&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```close()```
Simply closes the data that's already open and leaves you with an empty dictionary.


&emsp;

&emsp;
___

#### Other/Misc Methods:
###### _T4Json._ ```is_path_existent(path)```
Checks to see if ___path___ exist in the currently opened data structure. ```True``` is return if it does exist... and ```False``` otherwise.


&emsp;
###### _T4Json._ ```is_path_relative(path)```
Checks to see if ___path___ is a relative path. ```True``` is returned if it is... and ```False``` otherwise.


&emsp;

&emsp;

## Global Functions
###### ```is_valid_json_data(source)```
This function returns ```True``` if the JSON data is valid. Otherwise, it returns ```False```.

___source___ must be passed a string - File Path, URL, or JSON String.


&emsp;
###### ```convert_to_valid_json_ready_data(value)```
Converts _value_ into json ready data. It will remove any unsupported keys and convert the keys that are not string into strings.

## Examples
### Loading the Data
Note - ( Each one of the examples below is all by itself. )
To load json data simply pass the data in when initializing the t4json object. Examples:

```python
data = T4Json('example.json')
```
OR
```python
data = T4Json('https://api.github.com/users?since=100')
```
OR
```python
json_data = """{
"name": "John"
"age": 67
"wealth": "above average"
"family": null
}"""
data = T4Json(json_data)
```
If you want to load json data later or have already loaded json data and want to load something else then just call one of the load methods like so - ```data.load("new_example.json")```.

If you want to start with a clean slate and create json data from scratch then:
```python
data = T4Json()
# start adding items here
```
By default, when creating new json data, the initial data is just an empty dictionary. If you want to specify the starting data to work with... pass it to the ```new()``` method:
```python
fresh_start = {'version': 1.0}
data = T4Json()
data.new(fresh_start)
# start adding items here
```
Note - ( The ```new()``` method will simply create an empty dictionary if nothing is passed to it. )

&emsp;
### Using Paths to Navigate the Data
Note - ( This section assumes familiarity with absolute/relative paths within the file system. )
Once the data is loaded you can navigate it using paths - similar to a file/directory path. If you are working in some nested part of the data then you can set that as the current working level to make it easier to read/edit the data in there. For example:
Here is the json data in a file we will call ```settings.json```:
```json
{
  "internet": {
      "airplane mode": false,
      "wifi": [true, {"known": ["home", "office"]}],
      "wifi calling": false,
      "mobile hotspot": false,
      "mobile data": false
  },
  "bluetooth": [true, {"paired": ["headphones", "laptop"]}],
  "sound": {
    "volume": 65, "vibration": true,
    "ringtone": "guitar", "notification": "ping"
  },
  "display": {
    "brightness": {"auto": true, "level": 80},
    "wallpaper": "trees",
    "navigation bar": "gesture",
    "font": 70,
    "timeout time": 30
  }
}
```
Note - ( The default path separator is '\\\\' - two back slashes - make sure that the fist backslash is not escaped by the second backslash. This can be done by prefixing the string with an 'r'. You can change the path separator properties using the ```set_path_separator_properties()``` method. )

Here is some code being run in the terminal using paths to navigate the data. It shows the difference between absolute vs relative paths. 

Absolute:
```python
>>> data = T4Json('hero_file.json')
>>> data.read(r'display\\brightness\\auto')
True
>>> data.read(r'internet\\wifi\\1\\known')
['home', 'office']
>>> data.read(r'display\\brightness\\level')
80
>>> data.read('sound')
{'volume': 65, 'vibration': True, 'ringtone': 'guitar', 'notification': 'ping'}
```

Relative:
```python
>>> data.set_working_level(r'internet\\wifi\\1')
>>> data.read(r'.\\known\\0')
home
>>> data.read(r'.\\known')
['home', 'office']
>>> data.read(r'..\\0')
True
>>> data.read(r'..\\..\\..\\bluetooth\\1\\paired')
['headphones', 'laptop']
>>> data.read(r'..\\..\\..\\sound\\volume')
65
>>> data.read(r'..\\..\\..\\display\\brightness')
{'auto': True, 'level': 80}
```

Note - (There can be a separator at the beginning of the path if you want it. Sometimes it may be necessary to do that if there is a key that is an empty string "". This is because an empty string "" is used to access the base level. So both ```\\formed``` and ```formed``` would be the same thing.)
Using these relative paths we not only can read but can do all sorts of edits easily and without the hassle of always having to walk down the path of nested data.



&emsp;
### Searching the Data
You can search the data for a specific key if the keys value is not a pair container. We will use this [URL](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json) as an example:

```python
>>> data = T4Json('https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json')
>>> data.search('powers')
```
Look at the json data from the [URL](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json) and see how it looks compared to the searched data below.
```json
[
    "Radiation resistance", 
    "Turning tiny", 
    "Radiation blast", 
    "Million tonne punch", 
    "Damage resistance", 
    "Superhuman reflexes", 
    "Immortality", 
    "Heat Immunity", 
    "Inferno", 
    "Teleportation", 
    "Interdimensional travel"
]
```


&emsp;
### Flattening Nested Data
Flattening [nested data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesting_(computing)) is turning something like this ```[[1, 2, 3, [4, 5]], 6, 7, 8]``` into this ```[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]```. Nested data can be flattened using the _T4Json_.```flatten()``` method. Below is an example of flattening some data from this [URL](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json).

```python
>>> data = T4Json('https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json')
>>> data.flatten()
>>> data.read()
```
Look at the original json data from the [URL](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json) and compare it with the flattened data below.
```json
{
    "squadName": "Super Hero Squad", 
    "homeTown": "Metro City", 
    "formed": 2016, 
    "secretBase": "Super tower", 
    "active": true, 
    "name": [
        "Molecule Man", 
        "Madame Uppercut", 
        "Eternal Flame"
    ], 
    "age": [
        29, 
        39, 
        1000000
    ], 
    "secretIdentity": [
        "Dan Jukes", 
        "Jane Wilson", 
        "Unknown"
    ], 
    "powers": [
        "Radiation resistance", 
        "Turning tiny", 
        "Radiation blast", 
        "Million tonne punch", 
        "Damage resistance", 
        "Superhuman reflexes", 
        "Immortality", 
        "Heat Immunity", 
        "Inferno", 
        "Teleportation", 
        "Interdimensional travel"
    ]
}
```
