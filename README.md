The t4json module was created to make working with [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) data in python easier. It provides a bunch of tools to seamlessly open, __edit__ and save JSON data. The tools provided by t4json have tons of features so that you can do really specific things... if you only want to read a few values from some flat simple json data, then you might as well use the standard json module.

This module should work on any installation of python 3.6
or later on any OS right out of the box.

Check out the ___docs___ [here](https://cybergeek1943.github.io/t4json/).

__Outline:__
- Open up json data from a file, URL/Endpoint, or string with the T4Json class.
- Use methods to make some changes.
- Save changes.
- That's it. Your done..

&emsp;

### Features

- Use paths to navigate the json data just like in the file system. Also includes relative/absolute path navigating.
- Easily make changes like changing the name of a key, changing a value, adding new items, moving/copying items to new locations, deleting items, flattening, and more. All with easy to use and intuitive methods.
- Easily open up json data - simply pass a File Path, URL, or Json String when creating the T4Json object, and it will automatically figure out what is what and give you the data you need to work with.
- And more.

T4json is designed to simply and easily work with json data without any hassle. It can be used to make simple quick changes, more complex changes, or to just retrieve data. All with only a few lines of code that are easy to understand and read.

&emsp;

### Installation

Using pip:

```pip install t4json```

Or just download the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/cybergeek1943/t4json) and use as a local module within your projectâ€¦ which may be more useful if you want to make changes to it.

Try to keep this package up to date... this project is under active development and with every update there can be much more improvement on the previous version.


## Examples
### Loading the Data
To load json data simply pass the data in when initializing the t4json object.

Loading a **File**:
```python
data = T4Json('example.json')
```
Loading from a **URL/Endpoint**:
```python
data = T4Json('https://api.github.com/users?since=100')
```
Loading from a **string**:
```python
json_data = """{
"name": "John"
"age": 67
"wealth": "above average"
"family": null
}"""
data = T4Json(json_data)
```
Loading from a **dict/list**:
```python
dictionary = {'new_data': 512}
data = T4Json(dictionary)
```
If you want to load new data into the same T4Json instance after you have already loaded data - ```data.load("new_example.json")```.

If you want to start with a clean slate and create json data from scratch then:
```python
data = T4Json()
# start adding items here
```


&emsp;

&emsp;
### Using Paths to Navigate the Data
Note - ( This section assumes familiarity with absolute/relative paths within the file system. )
Once the data is loaded you can navigate it using paths - similar to a file/directory path. If you are working in some nested part of the data then you can set that as the current working level to make it easier to read/edit the data in there. For example:
Here is the json data in a file we will call ```settings.json```:
```json
{
  "internet": {
      "airplane mode": false,
      "wifi": [true, {"known": ["home", "office"]}],
      "wifi calling": false,
      "mobile hotspot": false,
      "mobile data": false
  },
  "bluetooth": [true, {"paired": ["headphones", "laptop"]}],
  "sound": {
    "volume": 65, "vibration": true,
    "ringtone": "guitar", "notification": "ping"
  },
  "display": {
    "brightness": {"auto": true, "level": 80},
    "wallpaper": "trees",
    "navigation bar": "gesture",
    "font": 70,
    "timeout time": 30
  }
}
```
Note - ( The default path separator is '\\' - two back slashes - make sure that the fist backslash is not escaped by the second backslash. This can be done by prefixing the string with an 'r' or by using '\\\\' as the seperator. You can change the path separator properties using the ```set_path_separator_properties()``` method. )

Here is some code being run in the terminal using paths to navigate the data. It shows the difference between absolute vs relative paths. 

Absolute:
```python
>>> data = T4Json('hero_file.json')
>>> data.read(r'display\\brightness\\auto')
True
>>> data.read(r'internet\\wifi\\1\\known')
['home', 'office']
>>> data.read(r'display\\brightness\\level')
80
>>> data.read('sound')
{'volume': 65, 'vibration': True, 'ringtone': 'guitar', 'notification': 'ping'}
```

Relative:
```python
>>> data.set_working_level(r'internet\\wifi\\1')
>>> data.read(r'.\\known\\0')
home
>>> data.read(r'.\\known')
['home', 'office']
>>> data.read(r'..\\0')
True
>>> data.read(r'..\\..\\..\\bluetooth\\1\\paired')
['headphones', 'laptop']
>>> data.read(r'..\\..\\..\\sound\\volume')
65
>>> data.read(r'..\\..\\..\\display\\brightness')
{'auto': True, 'level': 80}
```

Note - (There can be a separator at the beginning of the path if you want it. Sometimes it may be necessary to do that if there is a key that is an empty string "". This is because an empty string "" is used to access the base level. So both ```\\formed``` and ```formed``` would be the same thing.)
Using these relative paths we not only can read but can do all sorts of edits easily and without the hassle of always having to walk down the path of nested data.


&emsp;

&emsp;
### Searching the Data
You can search the data for a specific key if the keys value is not a pair container. We will use this [URL](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json) as an example:

```python
>>> data = T4Json('https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json')
>>> data.search('powers')
```
Look at the json data from the [URL](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json) and see how it looks compared to the searched data below.
```json
[
    "Radiation resistance", 
    "Turning tiny", 
    "Radiation blast", 
    "Million tonne punch", 
    "Damage resistance", 
    "Superhuman reflexes", 
    "Immortality", 
    "Heat Immunity", 
    "Inferno", 
    "Teleportation", 
    "Interdimensional travel"
]
```


&emsp;

&emsp;
### Flattening Nested Data
Flattening [nested data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesting_(computing)) is turning something like this ```[[1, 2, 3, [4, 5]], 6, 7, 8]``` into this ```[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]```. Nested data can be flattened using the _T4Json_.```flatten()``` method. 

There are basically, two different ways that T4Json data can be flattened:
1. **Grounding:** All the kay/value pairs (that do not contain containers as values) are moved to the base level. Any key/value pairs that have the same keys get their values combined or replaced.
2. **Chaining:** All the keys get chained togather. The values (that are not containers) remain the same.


&emsp;
#### Grounding:
We will be using the data from this [URL](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json) as example data.

```python
>>> data = T4Json('https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json')
>>> data.flatten()
>>> data
```
Look at the original json data from the [URL](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json) and compare it with the flattened data below.
```json
{
    "squadName": "Super Hero Squad", 
    "homeTown": "Metro City", 
    "formed": 2016, 
    "secretBase": "Super tower", 
    "active": true, 
    "name": [
        "Molecule Man", 
        "Madame Uppercut", 
        "Eternal Flame"
    ], 
    "age": [
        29, 
        39, 
        1000000
    ], 
    "secretIdentity": [
        "Dan Jukes", 
        "Jane Wilson", 
        "Unknown"
    ], 
    "powers": [
        "Radiation resistance", 
        "Turning tiny", 
        "Radiation blast", 
        "Million tonne punch", 
        "Damage resistance", 
        "Superhuman reflexes", 
        "Immortality", 
        "Heat Immunity", 
        "Inferno", 
        "Teleportation", 
        "Interdimensional travel"
    ]
}
```


&emsp;
#### Chaining:
We will be using this data as an example:
```json
{
  "internet": {
      "airplane mode": false,
      "wifi": [true, {"known": ["home", "office"]}],
      "wifi calling": false,
      "mobile hotspot": false
  },
  "bluetooth": [true, {"paired": ["headphones", "laptop"]}],
  "sound": {
    "volume": 65, "vibration": true,
    "ringtone": "guitar", "notification": "ping"
  },
  "display": {
    "brightness": {"auto": true, "level": 80},
    "wallpaper": "trees",
    "navigation bar": "gesture",
    "font": 70,
    "timeout time": 30
  }
}
```

We will then run the fallowing code to flatten the data:
```python
>>> data = T4Json('example.json')
>>> data.flatten(chain_keys=True)
>>> data
```

And here is the result:
```json
{
  "bluetooth": [true],
  "internet_airplane mode": false,
  "internet_wifi": [true],
  "internet_wifi calling": false,
  "internet_mobile hotspot": false,
  "sound_volume": 65,
  "sound_vibration": true,
  "sound_ringtone": "guitar",
  "sound_notification": "ping",
  "display_wallpaper": "trees",
  "display_navigation bar": "gesture",
  "display_font": 70,
  "display_timeout time": 30,
  "bluetooth_paired": ["headphones", "laptop"],
  "internet_wifi_known": ["home", "office"],
  "display_brightness_auto": true,
  "display_brightness_level": 80
}
```
Note - when there is only one item in a list such as ```{"bluetooth": [true]}``` from above, you can set the parameter ```convert_singular_lists``` of the ```flatten()``` method to ```True``` and the output will be ```{"bluetooth": true}``` instead of ```{"bluetooth": [true]}```.
